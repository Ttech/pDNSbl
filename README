pDNSbl is a simple php class that provides easy lookup to DNSbl results
it can handle multiple lookups from multiple DNSbl site such as:
efnetrbl, dronebl, spamhus, and many more!

This is the first version, so the examples and extras are not as much
as I would hope for. Expect to find a sample IRC bot to check users
that a) join b) connect to a IRC Network or Channel. 

Later versions expect a CodeIgniter class. 

Suggestions welcome. 
	Enjoy!
